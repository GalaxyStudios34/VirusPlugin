# VirusPlugin
A new Virus Plugin for Pocketmine-MP

# How does this Plugin work? 

With /infect <player> you can infect a player with the virus.
This player can then infect other players by hitting them and spreading the virus.
In addition, infected players emit spores twice a day, which then infect other players within a 20-block radius.
When players eat a golden apple they are cured of the virus. But you should hurry, because every time the spores are ejected, the infected player may die.
In addition, you can heal players from the virus with /heal <player>.

# How can I edit the messages and permissions? 

You can edit the messages in the message.yml file and the permissions in the plugin.yml
